//! This module provides primitives to work with `tracing`
//! and `tracing-subscriber` in Lambda functions.
//!
//! The `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` crates are re-exported
//! so you don't have to include them as direct dependencies in
//! your projects.

///     - if `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_LEVEL` is set, it takes precedence over any other environment variables.

///     - if none of those two variables are set, use `INFO` as the logging level.
///
/// The logging format can also be changed based on Lambda's advanced logging controls.
/// If the `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_FORMAT` environment variable is set to `JSON`, the log lines will be formatted as json objects,
/// otherwise they will be formatted with the default tracing format.

/// a lot of async concurrency. Since, writing to STDOUT can briefly block your tokio runtime - ref [tracing #2653](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/2653).
/// In that case, you might prefer to use [tracing_appender::NonBlocking] instead - particularly if your Lambda is fairly long-running and stays warm.

/// for ensuring gracefuls shutdown. See [`examples/graceful-shutdown`] for a complete example.
